    <h1>Safloet Verification Bot</h1>
    <p>A fully featured Discord bot with verification features for your RoK project/kingdom.</p>


    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <ul>
      The bot is designed to be used in a Discord server where users can verify their Rise of Kingdoms accounts.
      To use this bot, the user needs to send a screenshot of their Rise of Kingdoms account to the bot.
      The bot will then change the user's nickname to their Rise of Kingdoms name and assign them a role based on their alliance.
      This is a perfect solution for managing large communities in Rise of Kingdoms, ensuring that users are verified and can be easily identified by their in-game names and alliances.
    </ul>




    <h3>Base Version (5 EUR)</h3>
    This is the basic version of the bot, locked on version <code>4.0.0</code>.
    This bot will only receive crucial bug updates and nothing more, great for if you are not that interested in future features. It gets the job done, nothing more, nothing less.
    This bot will require Safloet to set up the bot entirely, there is nothing you can do yourself.

    <h3>Pro Version (15 EUR)</h3> 
    This is a better version of the bot, this one will receive updates every now and then with new features, such as OCR optimisation, more language options, and just more QoL updates.
    This is the perfect bot if you want the best possible, you want all possible features to make your server even better.
